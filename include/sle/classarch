BUFFER:
-Responsible: Edit and delete text.
-Holds: Text
-Notes: May share const pointer to text, others can view it.

CURSOR:
-Responsible: Move the cursor inside and between windows.
-Holds: Cursor position (and later other cursor info)
-Notes: Moving by XY coord or directions. Maybe also funtions to move to bounds (start/end of line/buf).
Should there be on for cli and one for buffer? Or can we go on with only one for the buffer?
-IN: Const pointer to text. Position to move the cursor (and window?).
-OUT: Function call to display the cursor in ncurses. Current coord.

FINDER:
-Responsible: Find positions in the text.
-Holds: Nothing.
-Notes: Compare to cursor movements. These require more searching through the structure.
-IN: Const pointer to text. Optional position (get from cursor if not given).
-OUT: Coord of the match. (Unset if not found).

PAGER:
-Responsible: Send portions of text to show on screen. keep tabs on where we are.
-Holds: Current position..
-Notes: Fits between buffer and screen. Needs to know window height. Also check
what happens with too long lines.
-IN: Context ofc.
-OUT: Vector of strings that will be displayed. No point in sending all the text
every time to the screen, if it cannot show everything.
-REFACTOR: for now make it so that moving down when cursor is on last line of the screen
will not move to next page. moving on pages will happen only with keys meant for that.


INSERTER/DELETER JNE:
-maybe do these in addition to buffer
-they would hold a non-const pointer to the text.

CHORDER:
-ottais inputin ja kattois sen ennen kun tehaan mitaan.
-taa vois olla hyva, varsinki jos tulee sit yli kahen keyn chordeja.

### NEXT ###
-toi leftRight ja varmaan upDown:
	-pitaa olla erikseen kun ollaan insert tilassa. silloin ei haittaa
	vaikka uusi positio olisi enemman kuin tekstin nykynen koko.
