BUFFER:
-Responsible: Edit and delete text.
-Holds: Text
-Notes: May share const pointer to text, others can view it.

CURSOR:
-Responsible: Move the cursor inside and between windows.
-Holds: Cursor position (and later other cursor info)
-Notes: Moving by XY coord or directions. Maybe also funtions to move to bounds (start/end of line/buf).
Should there be on for cli and one for buffer? Or can we go on with only one for the buffer?
-IN: Const pointer to text. Position to move the cursor (and window?).
-OUT: Function call to display the cursor in ncurses. Current coord.

FINDER:
-Responsible: Find positions in the text.
-Holds: Nothing.
-Notes: Compare to cursor movements. These require more searching through the structure.
-IN: Const pointer to text. Optional position (get from cursor if not given).
-OUT: Coord of the match. (Unset if not found).

PAGER:
-Responsible: Send portions of text to show on screen. keep tabs on where we are.
-Holds: Current position..
-Notes: Fits between buffer and screen. Needs to know window height. Also check
what happens with too long lines.
-IN: Context ofc.
-OUT: Vector of strings that will be displayed. No point in sending all the text
every time to the screen, if it cannot show everything.
